# Snake-Game
<b>Project Description:</b>\
We have a rattlesnake in a desert, and our snake is initially two units long (head and
rattler). We have to collect with our snake the foods on the level, that appears randomly.
Only one food piece is placed randomly at a time on the level (on a field, where there is
no snake).\
The snake starts off from the center of the level in a random direction. The player can
control the movement of the snakeâ€™s head with keyboard buttons. If the snake eats a food
piece, then its length grow by one unit.


It makes the game harder that there are rocks in the desert. If the snake collides with a
rock, then the game ends. We also lose the game, if the snake goes into itself, or into the
boundary of the game level.\
In these situations show a popup messagebox, where the player can type his name and
save it together with the amount of food eaten to the database. Create a menu item,
which displays a highscore table of the players for the 10 best scores. Also, create a menu
item which restarts the game.
